# Travel App

The Travel App is a Web site designed in React JS to help users plan their trips and make the most of their travels. With a simple and intuitive interface, the app allows users to search hotels

## Requirements

Getting Started
To run the Travel App locally, follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/travel-app.git

####Install the dependencies:
Copy code
npm install
Start the development server:
sql
Copy code
npm start
Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser to view the app.

The Travel App was created with React.js 18 and Styled Components. If you encounter any issues, please refer to the React.js documentation and the Styled Components documentation.

To build the app for production, run:

arduino
Copy code
npm run build
This will create an optimized production build in the build directory.

We recommend that you use a modern web browser to ensure the best user experience.

## Programming paradigm

This code uses Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) paradigm in Python. The main class Receipt contains attributes and methods to extract the relevant data from the OCR output.

## Assumptions

This code assumes that the input JSON file has OCR output in the "fullTextAnnotation" key of the "pages" array of the JSON object. If there is no OCR output in that location, the code will fail.

This code also assumes that the receipt has a certain structure, such as the presence of a date, address, invoice number, and item prices in the text. If these elements are not present or are in a different format, the code may not extract the correct information.

## Coding Style

This script was developed following the PEP8 style guide for Python code.

## Usage

The script can be run from the command line with the following command:

```bash
  python receipt.py
```
Output file first ticket:

## Testing

This script has been tested using pytest, with the tests located in the test_receipt_ticket1.py and test_receipt_ticket2.py files. To run the tests, simply run the following command:

```bash
  pytest -v
```
Note that currently, the script is failing to obtain the tax codes for one of the example invoices.
